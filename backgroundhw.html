            <strong>Formation and Early History</strong><br>
            <strong>The Giant-Impact Hypothesis:</strong><br> The prevailing scientific theory is that the Moon formed from the massive collision of the
            proto-Earth with a Mars-sized body, called Theia.<br>
            <strong>Debris and Accretion:</strong><br> This violent impact created a disk of debris around Earth that eventually coalesced, or accreted,
            into the Moon.<br>
            <strong>Magma Ocean:</strong> <br>In its infancy, the Moon was a molten ball of liquid rock, a magma ocean, from which its distinct layers of
            core, mantle, and crust differentiated.<br>
           <strong> Geological Evolution</strong><br>
            <strong>Impacts and Craters:</strong><br> During the first hundreds of millions of years, the young Moon was heavily bombarded by asteroids
            and comets, creating its heavily cratered surface and the large basins still visible today.<br>
            <strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong><br> From about 4.2 to 1.2 billion years ago, lava flowed from the Moon's interior through cracks in its
            crust, filling some of the ancient impact basins to form the dark, flat plains known as maria.<br>
            <strong>Regolith Formation:</strong><br> The Moon's surface is now covered with a layer of pulverized rock and dust called regolith, created
            by billions of years of meteorite impacts.<br>
            Human Interaction and Study<br>
           <strong> Ancient Timekeeping:</strong><br>Early humans observed the Moon's phases to track time, understand the seasons, and develop
            calendars.<br>
            <strong>Space Exploration:</strong><br> The Moon was humanity's first destination in space, with the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s
            bringing back rock samples that provided crucial evidence for the giant-impact theory.<br>
            <strong>Continued Research:</strong><br> Unmanned probes and orbital missions have continued to study the Moon, gathering data on its
            composition and structure, and uncovering evidence of its deep past.<br>
